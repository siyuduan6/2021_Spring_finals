# The Relationships of Gun Violence, Educational Attainment, Poverty Status And Unemployment Rate in US
## Introduction
Gun violence represents a major threat to the health and safety of all Americans. According to the simple analysis from the gun violence data, the number of gun violence cases has steadily increased by more than 4 years. The argument about banning guns was always a controversial topic in the United States. Some people might say the gun should not be banned because every gun shooting should blame the person who uses the gun, not the gun itself. So we were thinking if there any correlation between the gun violence rate and the education level, poverty status, and unemployment.
